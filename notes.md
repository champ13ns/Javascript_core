Classes -> Blueprints.
Objects -> Real instances.

In JS we have a class keyword.
Inside the class we have
    - properties -> name,price,desc,rating
    - behaviours -> update,display
    properties are called as data-members.
    behavoiours are called as member-functions.

    To define member functions, we can just write normal functions in the class, we need some special function
which doesn't qualify as member function, we call it a constructor.
By calling constructor new objects can be created.



-------------------------------- this -----------------------
`this` keyword in JS, is entirely different from CPP and Java.
 in JS this keyword, references to the calling side, i.e from where the function or class is called

 `new` -> it looks like new keyword, only calls constructor, but it does a lot more than that.
 new keyword, is not only associated with classes, it can be use with 'functions' also
